I lead the full stack development team on [protools](https://www.farmersedge.ca/smartpro/) atÂ [](https://autovance.com/)Farmers Edge. My team works on two applications for Farmers Edge responsible for two applications used for variable rate technology.

The first application is ZoneManager, which is responsible for taking satellite imagery for a farmers field, and generating a ZoneMap (GeoJSON) which has polygons representing different zones for the field. In addition to this, we have a suite of tools that are used to edit these ZoneMaps after the zoning process for greater control over how a field is zoned for variable rate.

The second application is RxPro, which is responsible for taking in information about soil, zones, products, and a number of other variables and produces prescriptions for a field for variable rate applications. These can be used for seeding, fertilizing, and crop protection. 

I am very interested in blockchain technology, and what this is doing to disrupt the world of finance, and identity. This technology feels like it is laying down the groundwork for the "Internet of Finance" or "Internet of Identity", much like the groundwork laid in the 20th century for the "Internet of Information". I would love to enter as soon as possible. There is so much potential for good with this technology, and I would love to be one of the early developers shaping the landscape for this.
